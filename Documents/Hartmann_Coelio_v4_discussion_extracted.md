P015: Abstract

P016: Aim
Laparoscopic surgery is increasingly used in emergency settings, but its role in generalized diverticular peritonitis remains debated. We aimed to compare laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure with open sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis and diverting ileostomy.

P017: Methods
This retrospective study used a national multicenter cohort from the Association Française de Chirurgie, including 7,053 patients who underwent surgery for colonic diverticulitis. We included emergency cases with generalized peritonitis (Hinchey III or IV) treated by laparoscopic Hartmann or open anastomosis with ileostomy. Elective cases, Hinchey I–II, or other procedures were excluded. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative outcomes and stoma-free survival were compared after propensity score matching on preoperative variables.

P018: Results
A total of 285 patients met inclusion criteria (138 laparoscopic Hartmann, 147 open anastomosis). After matching, 101 patients were included in each group. Baseline characteristics were comparable. 30% of the overall population had Hinchey IV diverticulitis. Conversion was required in 49% of the laparoscopic Hartmann cases. Laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure did not confer significant benefits concerning postoperative outcomes including 90-day morbidity (53% vs 50%, p = 0.8), major complications (27% vs 26%, p > 0.9), 90-day mortality (5% vs 3%, p = 0.7), or length of hospital stay (12 vs 10 days, p = 0.095), and was associated with fewer stoma reversal (70% vs 88%, p = 0.002), with longer delay (144 vs 113 days, p = 0.068). Stoma-free survival at 2 years was significantly better in the anastomosis group (88% vs 70%, respectively; log-rank p < 0.0001; Cox model HR = 2.28 [1.39–2.44], p < 0.0001).

P019: Conclusion
Although early outcomes were comparable, the minimally invasive Hartmann’s procedure was associated with fewer stoma reversals and poorer stoma-free survival. When feasible, open primary anastomosis should remain the preferred approach.

P021: Introduction

P022: Acute perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis (Hinchey III–IV) is a surgical emergency requiring rapid source control while balancing postoperative morbidity and the risk of a permanent stoma 1,2. Historically, Hartmann’s procedure was the standard of care but is associated with substantial morbidity, non-negligible mortality, and low reversal rates3,4. Following recent randomized trials and meta-analyses, national and international guidelines have shifted the paradigm, now favoring sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis when possible, as it offers similar short-term safety but significantly higher reversal rates and better long term stoma-free survival than Hartmann’s Procedure, reserving the latter for unstable of very high-risk patients 5–12. Regarding the omission of a diverting stoma, guidelines remain cautious, suggesting unprotected anastomosis only for highly selected cases. As results from ongoing randomized trials assessing the specific role of diversion are still awaited and primary anastomosis protected by a diverting ileostomy remains the safest standard of care for generalized peritonitis 13.

P023: Over the same period, minimally invasive colorectal surgery has expanded into the emergency setting 14,15. While laparoscopic peritoneal lavage has fallen out of favor due to high rates of persistent sepsis, laparscopic sigmoid resection has emerged as a feasible option16–18. Current data suggest that in experienced hands, emergency laparoscopic resection reduces parietal morbidity and hospital stay compared to open surgery 19–22. However, the specific role of the Laparoscopic Hartmann’s Procedure (LHP) remains debated. Limited retrospective or registry-based datas suggest that this procedure can be performed safely and may reduce overall complications and length of stay compared with open Hartmann’s procedure.

P024: Crucially, the potential benefits of LHP may extend beyond the acute phase. The low reversal rate of the Hartmann’s strategy is often attributed to dense intra-abdominal adhesions formed after open surgery. Emerging evidence suggests that performing the initial Hartmann’s procedure laparoscopically may reduces adhesion formation, thereby facilitating a subsequent laparoscopic reversal 22,23. This "minimally invasive two-stage strategy" could potentially combine the immediate safety of a non-restorative procedure with a higher likelihood of successful future restoration of bowel continuity.

P025: It remains unclear, however, whether this minimally invasive approach can compete with the current standard of care. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in a large national cohort, whether Laparoscopic Hartmann’s Procedure offers comparable short-term outcomes and stoma-free survival to Open Sigmoid Resection with Primary Anastomosis and diverting ileostomy.

P026: Patients and Methods

P027: Patients

P028: Data were obtained from a retrospective multicenter database including all adult patients operated on for sigmoid diverticulitis (SD) between January 2010 and September 2021 across 43 French centers. This analysis is part of a study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06200857). The need for informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective study design.

P029: Patients were included if they underwent emergency surgery for SD peritonitis classified as Hinchey III or IV, treated either by open resection with primary anastomosis and diverting stoma or by laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure.

P030: Exclusion criteria included: scheduled or non-urgent surgery, Hinchey stages < III, surgical approaches other than the two evaluated strategies, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score = 4 and/or preoperative admission to an intensive care unit. These latter criteria were used as a surrogate for hemodynamic instability, a parameter not recorded in the database.

P031: Endpoints

P032: Primary Endpoint

P033: The primary outcome was the 24-month stoma-free survival, defined as the time from the index emergency surgery to the successful restoration of intestinal continuity, with patients censored at death, loss to follow-up, or at 24 months if no stoma reversal had occurred.

P034: Secondary Endpoints

P035: Secondary outcomes included intraoperative morbidity (any adverse event occurring during the index procedure), the conversion rate in the LHP group, postoperative morbidity according to Clavien–Dindo classification24, length of hospital stay, recurrent diverticulitis during follow-up, and the occurrence of incisional hernias.

P036: Surgical procedure

P037: Two types of procedure were assessed: the Laparoscopic Hartmann’s Procedure (LHP group)25, consisting of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with rectal closure and an end colostomy, with or without conversion to open surgery; and the Open sigmoidectomy with a primary anastomosis with a defunctioning stoma (OPA group), Decisions concerning the lowering of the splenic flexure and abdominal drainage were left at the surgeon’s discretion.

P038: Statistical analysis

P039: In this observational study, propensity score matching was used to reduce selection bias related to the surgical approach and other confounding factors, ensuring comparability between groups by adjusting for baseline differences between patients undergoing either LHP or OPA. Propensity scores were estimated using multivariable logistic regression including all pre-specified covariates. These covariates comprised age, sex, smoking history, BMI, ASA score, immunodepression, anticoagulant therapy, previous laparotomy, and the Hinchey classification. These factors were selected as known confounders of both the choice of surgical approach and perioperative outcomes. An "optimal" case-control match without replacement was used, minimizing abdolute differences in propensity scores 26. Covariate balance after matching was assessed using standardized mean differences (SMD), with values < 0.1 indicating adequate balance (Supplementary Figure S1) 26.  Missing data were addressed using pairwise deletion. Continuous variables were reported as median ± interquartile range (IQR) and compared using paired t-tests for approximately normally distributed variables (normality assessed visually and with the Shapiro–Wilk test), or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests otherwise. Categorical variables were expressed as frequency (%) and compared within matched pairs using McNemar’s test.

P040: A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare 24-month stoma-free survival between the two groups in the matched cohort. To account for the matched design, models were fitted using a robust sandwich variance estimator clustered on matched pairs 27 . Additionally, a supplementary analysis separated patients who underwent a laparoscopic Hartmann procedure with or without conversion, to explore whether conversion affected stoma-free survival.

P041: Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio software version 4.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

P042: Results

P043: Preoperative characteristics

P044: A total of 1,521 patients underwent surgery for diverticular peritonitis (Hinchey III or IV) between January 2010 and September 2021 across 43 centers, including 34 university hospitals. The final study population comprised 284 patients: 138 in the LHP group and 146 in the OPA group (Fig. 1). After propensity score matching, two comparable groups of 101 patients each were obtained, with adequate balance across all baseline covariates (SMD < 0.1 for covariates included; Supplementary Fig. S1).

P045: Before matching, patients in the LHP group were older (median age 63 vs 50 years, p = 0.03), more frequently classified as ASA 3 (26% vs 17%, p = 0.04), and had a higher proportion of Hinchey IV peritonitis (37% vs 23%, p = 0.01). Other baseline characteristics were similar between groups.

P046: After matching, severe diverticulitis remained frequent, with Hinchey IV peritonitis observed in 31% of patients in the LHP group and 29% in the OPA group, and no other differences in preoperative characteristics were observed (Table 1).Flowchart + quels patientsTableau 1

P047: Intraoperative findings and adverse events

P048: In the propensity score–matched (PSM cohort, intraoperative outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Median operative time tended to be shorter in the LHP group compared with the OPA group (138 [100–169] vs 180 [120–240] minutes), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.065). Conversion to open surgery occurred in 49% of patients undergoing LHP.

P049: Splenic flexure mobilization was performed far less frequently in the LHP group than in the OPA group (15% vs 72%, p < 0.001), as was high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (4.9% vs 14%, p = 0.003), with high ligation defined as division of the inferior mesenteric artery proximal to the origin of the left colic artery 28. As expected, anastomosis was performed exclusively in the OPA group, most commonly as a latero-lateral configuration (59%), Intraoperative transfusion rates were low and comparable between groups (3.3% vs 4.3%, p > 0.9).

P050: Tableau 2

P051: Postoperative outcomes

P052: Postoperative outcomes are detailed in Table 3. Overall 90-day morbidity was high but comparable between groups (53% in the LHP group vs 50% in the OPA group, p = 0.6). Ninety-day mortality did not significantly differ (5.0% vs 3.0%, p = 0.5), nor did the rate of intensive care unit admission (16% vs 11%, p = 0.3).

P053: The severity of postoperative complications was similar between groups, with no difference in the distribution of Clavien–Dindo grades (p = 0.5). Severe complications (Clavien–Dindo >2) occurred in 27% of patients in the LHP group and 26% in the OPA group (p > 0.9). Rates of intraperitoneal abscess were comparable (7.1% vs 9.0%, p = 0.6). Anastomotic leakage was observed in 8 patients (8%) in the OPA group/ Reintervention rates, median length of stay and thirty-day readmission rates were comparable.

P054: Longer-term postoperative events, including incisional hernia (21% vs 23%), anastomotic stenosis, and recurrence of diverticulitis, were not significantly different between groups,.

P056: Stoma Free Survival

P057: (Figure 1). At 24 months, the probability of being stoma-free was higher in the OPA group than in the LHP group (88% vs 70%, respectively; stratified log-rank p < 0.0001) (Figure 1). The median follow-up duration, estimated using the reverse Kaplan–Meier method, was 671 days in the LHP group and 390 days in the OPA group. In the Cox proportional hazards model accounting for the matched design with robust standard errors, OPA was associated with a significantly higher rate of stoma closure compared with LHP (HR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.39–2.44; p < 0.001), corresponding to a shorter time to stoma-free status (Table 4).

P058: Additionally, a supplementary analysis according to conversion status within the LHP group was performed (Supplementary Fig. S2). OPA was associated with a higher rate of stoma closure compared with both converted (HR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.12–2.27; p = 0.01) and non-converted LHP (HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.44–3.01; p < 0.001). No significant difference in stoma-free survival was observed between converted and non-converted LHP (HR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.85–2.13; p = 0.21)

P059: Discussion

P060: The present study assessed the role of laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure (LHP) for acute perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis (Hinchey III–IV), using open sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis and diverting ileostomy (OPA) as the reference strategy.

P061: The main finding of this propensity score–matched comparison is that long-term stoma-free survival was lower after LHP than after OPA, despite similar short-term outcomes. At 24 months, the probability of being stoma-free was 88% in the OPA group versus 70% in the LHP group (log-rank p < 0.0001). In time-to-event analysis, OPA was associated with a higher rate of stoma closure compared with LHP (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.39–2.44; p < 0.001), corresponding to a shorter time to stoma-free status. These findings indicate that a minimally invasive approach does not overcome the intrinsic limitations of a non-restorative strategy.

P062: Randomized trials have established primary anastomosis as the preferred reconstructive strategy over Hartmann’s procedure for perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis. In both the LADIES (DIVA arm) and DIVERTI trials, short-term outcomes were broadly comparable between strategies, whereas long-term stoma outcomes favored primary anastomosis 8,10. However, these trials were not designed to assess surgical approach and did not report the proportion of laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedures; therefore, they do not address whether laparoscopy can mitigate the long-term limitations of a non-restorative strategy.

P063: Accordingly, we selected open primary anastomosis with diverting ileostomy as the reference strategy, as it reflects contemporary practice for stable patients with generalized peritonitis. Although omission of diversion has been proposed in selected cases, guidelines remain cautious and generally restrict unprotected anastomosis to highly selected patients 5–7.  In the absence of definitive randomized evidence specifically addressing diversion in generalized peritonitis, a protected anastomosis remains the most widely accepted benchmark for this population 13.

P064: A key complementary result comes from the analysis according to conversion status within the LHP group, in which conversion occurred in approximately half of cases. This rate is consistent with that reported in unselected emergency laparoscopic cohorts, and contrasts with the much lower conversion rates described in highly selected expert series 19,20,22. Despite this high conversion rate, OPA remained associated with a higher rate of stoma closure compared with both converted and non-converted LHP, while no significant difference in stoma-free survival was observed between converted and non-converted LHP. These findings indicate that the unfavorable long-term trajectory after LHP is not explained by secondary conversion to an open Hartmann’s procedure, but rather reflects the intrinsic limitations of the Hartmann strategy itself, regardless of surgical approach. The present dataset did not allow analysis of the specific causes of conversion, which prevents exploring whether conversion was driven by disease severity, technical difficulty, or intraoperative findings.

P065: Laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure has been advocated on theoretical grounds in this emergency setting, including reduced parietal trauma and wound morbidity, potentially faster postoperative recovery, and the hypothesis that a minimally invasive first stage may facilitate subsequent reversal by limiting adhesions 29. However, in our study, short-term outcomes were similar between strategies, with no significant differences in 90-day morbidity or mortality. This aligns with findings from Turley et al., in which a laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure did not significantly reduce postoperative morbidity or mortality compared with open surgery in emergency diverticulitis 19. Although laparoscopy is associated with improved outcomes in elective colorectal surgery, recent reviews suggests these benefits are not consistently seen in emergency settings, and reviews of emergency laparoscopic colorectal surgery indicate that the technical challenges of peritonitis can limit the expected advantages of a minimally invasive approach 30–33.

P066: The anastomotic leak rate observed in the OPA group (8%) deserves focused discussion because it intersects directly with the question of diversion. Generalized peritonitis has historically raised concern regarding anastomotic safety, yet contemporary randomized and observational data consistently show that leak rates are acceptable when diversion is used, and that the short-term risk profile remains comparable to Hartmann’s procedure in selected patients. The present results do not provide a basis to advocate omission of diversion in this setting; rather, they support the pragmatic interpretation that a protected anastomosis represents a reasonable balance between safety and the long-term benefit of higher stoma-free survival 13,34,35.

P067: The present findings can be positioned within the limited and heterogeneous observational literature on minimally invasive emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis. Vennix et al. reported that emergency laparoscopic sigmoid resection is feasible in selected settings and may be associated with lower morbidity and shorter hospital stay compared with open surgery, but their analysis primarily addressed the impact of surgical approach within mixed reconstructive strategies and therefore cannot establish strategy-level equivalence 20. Turley et al., using a large propensity-matched NSQIP analysis restricted to Hartmann’s procedures, found no significant short-term advantage of laparoscopy over open surgery, although interpretation is limited by the absence of granular clinical data and by the lack of information on Hinchey status or on long-term stoma outcomes 19. At the other end of the spectrum, Cassini et al. described a totally laparoscopic two-step strategy with high feasibility of laparoscopic reversal in selected patients treated in expert centers, providing proof of technical feasibility rather than comparative evidence against reconstructive strategies 22. Taken together, these studies support that LHP is feasible and may improve selected perioperative metrics in some contexts, but they do not demonstrate equivalence with the contemporary benchmark strategy of primary anastomosis with diversion for long-term stoma-free survival, an issue directly addressed by the present matched comparative design.

P068: Our findings support a pragmatic interpretation for current practice in generalized diverticular peritonitis. In this matched national cohort, performing Hartmann’s procedure laparoscopically did not translate into clearly improved short-term outcomes and did not offset the long-term functional disadvantage inherent to a non-restorative strategy. When patients are stable and eligible for reconstruction, open sigmoid resection with protected primary anastomosis therefore remains the reference approach to maximize the likelihood of long-term stoma-free survival.

P069: This study has several strengths that support the robustness and relevance of the present findings. It relies on a national multicenter surgical database (AFC), provides one of the largest reported series specifically focused on laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure in this emergency indication, and uses propensity score matching to reduce baseline imbalance when benchmarking LHP against the contemporary reference strategy. Nonetheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. As a retrospective analysis, the comparison remains exposed to residual confounding despite propensity-score matching. Key clinical variables were not available, including the initial intention regarding restoration of continuity, which may have influenced both treatment allocation and subsequent stoma management. Approximately half of LHP required conversion, and the dataset did not capture the reasons for conversion. Additionnaly, detailed information on the modalities of restoration of continuity was not available (surgical approach at reversal and whether reconstruction was performed with or without diversion), and quality-of-life outcomes were not collected.

P070: In conclusion, in a propensity score–matched national multicenter cohort, laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure was associated with lower long-term stoma-free survival than open sigmoid resection with protected primary anastomosis, while short-term outcomes were similar. The conversion-status analysis suggests that this difference is unlikely to be driven by conversion itself. These findings support that, in stable patients with generalized diverticular peritonitis, sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis protected by a diverting ileostomy should remain the preferred strategy, whereas Hartmann’s procedure should be reserved for unstable or very high-risk patients.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of remaining stoma-free (stoma-free survival) are shown for patients undergoing LHP compared with those undergoing OPA, with follow-up censored at 24 months. The difference between groups was assessed using a stratified log-rank test accounting for the matched pairs. Corresponding p-value from the stratified log-rank test is reported. Numbers of patients at risk at selected time points are shown below the plot.

P406: Standardized mean differences (SMD) are shown for all covariates in the unmatched (red) and matched (blue) samples. The vertical dotted line represents the predefined threshold for acceptable balance (SMD < 0.1). After matching, all covariates exhibited SMD values < 0.1, indicating excellent covariate balance between groups.
