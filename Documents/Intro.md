Acute perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis (Hinchey III–IV) is one of the most demanding emergencies in colorectal surgery. It affects often elderly, comorbid patients and requires rapid and durable source control while limiting postoperative morbidity and the risk of a permanent stoma. Recent national and international guidelines have reshaped management, emphasizing a more selective indication for emergency surgery and a tailored choice between non-restorative procedures and primary anastomosis. 

Historically, Hartmann’s procedure was considered the standard operation for generalized diverticular peritonitis, but it is associated with substantial morbidity, non-negligible mortality and low rates of stoma reversal, with many patients ultimately left with a permanent colostomy. Over the last decade, several randomized trials and meta-analyses have compared Hartmann’s procedure with sigmoid resection and primary colorectal anastomosis, usually protected by a diverting loop ileostomy. These studies, including the multicenter trial by Oberkofler et al., the DIVA arm of the LADIES trial, and other randomized and observational series, consistently suggest that, in hemodynamically stable patients with Hinchey III–IV peritonitis, primary anastomosis with diversion achieves similar early morbidity and mortality but higher stoma reversal rates and better long-term stoma-free survival than Hartmann’s procedure.  In line with this evidence, recent international guidelines (WSES, ASCRS, European societies) and French recommendations now favor resection with primary anastomosis and diverting ileostomy in selected stable patients, reserving Hartmann’s procedure mainly for unstable or very high-risk patients. 

In parallel, laparoscopic peritoneal lavage was explored as a less invasive alternative to resection in Hinchey III diverticulitis. Early case series and observational studies suggested promising short-term outcomes, but large randomized trials such as SCANDIV and the LOLA arm of the LADIES trial failed to demonstrate superiority or even non-inferiority of lavage over resection, and reported higher rates of persistent sepsis, reoperation and abscess formation.  Consequently, both international and French guidelines no longer recommend routine laparoscopic lavage for generalized purulent peritonitis, and resection (Hartmann or primary anastomosis) remains the reference surgical strategy in this setting. 

Over the same period, laparoscopy has become standard in elective sigmoidectomy and has progressively extended to emergency surgery for complicated diverticulitis. Propensity-matched cohorts and expert consensus statements report that, in selected emergency cases, laparoscopic sigmoid resection is associated with reduced postoperative morbidity, fewer wound complications, shorter hospital stay and at least comparable mortality compared with open surgery. However, most emergency series combine primary anastomosis and Hartmann’s procedures, and only a few observational studies have specifically reported outcomes of laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure, often as part of damage-control strategies or small single-center experiences. As a result, current guidelines provide little specific guidance on the role of laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure in generalized diverticular peritonitis, and it remains unclear whether this minimally invasive non-restorative strategy can truly combine the perceived safety of Hartmann’s operation with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. 

In France, for hemodynamically stable patients with Hinchey III–IV diverticulitis, the reference operation is an open sigmoid resection with primary colorectal anastomosis protected by a diverting ileostomy, while Hartmann’s procedure is mainly recommended for unstable or very high-risk patients.  Whether performing Hartmann’s procedure laparoscopically can provide the benefits of Hartmann’s non-restorative strategy without the excess mortality and abdominal wall morbidity of laparotomy, when compared with this open reference procedure, remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate, in a large national cohort of patients operated on for generalized diverticular peritonitis, whether laparoscopic Hartmann’s procedure offers different short-term outcomes and stoma-free survival compared with open sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis and diverting ileostomy, which currently represents the standard of care in France.
